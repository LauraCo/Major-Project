Supervisor Meeting #2
====
*1st February 2016*

**Different Image Metrics**
* Neil will send over papers
* Fuzzy Entropy:
	* defined in a number of different ways 
	* different definitions give different alignments
	* Shannon Fuzzy Entropy
* Look at 2 or 3 different types from standard entropy
* Just try and figure out what the terms are in the equations, so can replicate in code

**Data Sets**
* MIAS:
	* Old
	* Still widely used
	* 322 images 
* DDSN:
	* Imagers *much* larger
	* Best not to use
* Avoid ones with abnormalities when making the mean
* Don't need to worry about resolution
* Ground Truth - Neil will help find which BI-RADS category they fall into
* Need 3 (approx.) images - all physically different in sizing etc, make the alignment vaguely difficult

**OPS notes**
* Tasks:
	* GUI (both a task and deliverable)
	* Research into different metrics
	* Research how to display a mean image
	* How many images to use to make the mean?

**Congealing code**
* Neil could talk to Harry about the work they did on it?
* Or email Learned-Miller:
	* how does it fit together?
	* hierarchical structure?

Need to check 394 page to ensure meeting the software engineering requirements - I think I am 

Could meet with Erica Denton?
* NHS England Radiologist
* Research focus 
* Could show mean images, see if anything of interest in them
* Could mean some travelling 

**Decided to take an XP approach**
* Watch out for PP aspect
* Because of experimental, research nature I thought this was best
