Supervisor Meeting #3
====
*8th February 2016*

Hybrid Entropy:
* Introduces 'true' fuzziness

Fuzzy Equivalence Relations:
* Is what Neil & Harry used in their paper
* Computationally costly as has to create all the matrices

Classic entropy:
* Only deals in binary values

Î¼ = membership / degree of similarity

| | = absolute value, don't worry about if pos/neg

With membership, if falls within 2, typically use the highest

Start with MNIST:
* Choose 1 or 2 Sets - 4 pictures of each
* See how each fairs with the entropy values

Final:
* Use 10/15 input images maximum

GUI:
* Provide preview of input images
 * If too many, show sample?
* Provide statistic on image
  * distribution of pixel values in histogram
