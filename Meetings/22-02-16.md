Supervisor Meeting #5
====
*22nd February 2016*

* Î¼ for each pixel in an image
* Registration = aligning images
* Floor = minimum
  * Could email Harry if more needed
* H* = H prime
* H with roof = H mean

* -K
  * Positive constant
  * Usually 1/n


* n membership function = 3
  * then /3 to get the mean

Formula 4 isn't 'proper' as not all 4 constraints hold

* -c is fuzziness
  * 1/n fine for this too


* Formula 11 might be useful
