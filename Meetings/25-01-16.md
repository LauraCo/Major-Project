Supervisor Meeting #1

CS39440 has specifications which require certain Software Engineering elements to fulfill the BCS accreditation. In the case of my dissertation, this will include at least a GUI - but may extend further to develop my own congealing method.

2 ways to approach breast cancer detection:
1. Abnormality detection
  * However # of instances where an abnormality is actually present is low
  * Abnormality does not always show up in scans
2. Cancer risk assessment
  * BI-RADS
  * 4 classes of breast tissue composition
    * 1 - Fattiest (low risk)
    * 4 - Dense (high risk)

The idea would be to:
* use the 2nd type of detection
* take each composition category in turn
* align using different types of metrics and comparing the results
  * different metrics give different outputs - some may be more useful than others
  * the GUI must be able to allow the user to change metric at will

How?
* Iterate across images (start with 3)
* Extract sections
* Get value (an average) for that class of composition

*Goal: output average image after congealing*

Stretch goal:
* Predict on new mammography scans
* Create a roadmap for detection  

Different types of Metric:
* Entropy
* Fuzzy Entropy
* Research more

## To-Do
* Congealing:
  * How it works
  * Look at Objective-C code - understand it?
* Look at MNIST data
  * Good starting point as mammography images v.large
* Look for Java version of Congealing code
  * Maybe contact Erik G. Learned-Miller about known Java version?
* Initial GUI design ideas
