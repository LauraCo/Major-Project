Supervisor Meeting #6
====
*29th February 2016*

* Something is wrong with De Luca Fuzzy?
  * Not actually... MNIST is binary
  * Grey-level membership won't work well for black/white images


* Toy example:
  * Get 3 or 4 MNIST data images
  * Edit greylevel in gimp
  * Then do these congeal?


* Poster advice
  * Don't need to refer to author
  * 'Mammograms' instead of mammography scans
  * Mammograms more useful as different tissue has different radiolucency, some reflects more back
  * Change BI-RADS to tissue density
  * Tissue density can be used to identify risk for breast cancer
  * Emphasise why it's important
    * Human impact
  * Future work   
    * Could be applied to other medical imagery
    * E.g. MRI for prostate 


  * General notes:
    * Radiologists expensive to train
    * Their time is costly
    * More expensive to treat than to do early prevention
    * Identify common areas of density from women from different categories
    * Prevention > Detection
    * Help to train new Radiologists


  * General problem:
    * Lots of images
    * How do we decide what an average image looks like
    * This is where congealing comes in
    * Different metrics produces different results  
      * Each tell something different
