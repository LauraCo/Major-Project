Supervisor Meeting #4
====
*15th February 2016*

* Neil to email Harry about looking at their research code for an example

** How does the Membership graph link to μ? **
* Look at Triangular Norm / Fuzzy Union
* Could also look at distribution across all scans
  * Probablility Distribution (/ Density) Function

T_Norm = max(μ1, μ2,..., μn)  -> Just takes the set with the highest μ

** Can I use MIAS dataset on Poster? **
* Yes, it's publically available
* Neil has ground truths to go with MIAS so can create BI-RAD chart

*Could* combine histograms from all the images into 1 big histogram
  * Derive fuzzy sets from this
