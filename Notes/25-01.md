* Keep all work, even if it doesn't work - make sure you tie notes to it so you can relate back to it at the end of the project
* Plan to keep blog posts to keep an online diary of work
* Look on OpenCV - might be some information on there
* Neil worked with Harry on Congealing - worth reaching out to Harry?
