\chapter{Results and Conclusions}

This section should discuss issues you encountered as you tried to implement your experiments. What were the results of running the experiments? What conclusions can you draw from these results? During the work, you might have found that elements of your experiments were unnecessary or overly complex; perhaps third party libraries were available that simplified some of the functions that you intended to implement. If things were easier in some areas, then how did you adapt your project to take account of your findings?It is more likely that things were more complex than you first thought. In particular, were there any problems or difficulties that you found during implementation that you had to address? Did such problems simply delay you or were they more significant? If you had multiple experiments to run, it may be sensible to discuss each experiment in separate sections.
