\section{Project description}
%==============================================================================

The Project builds upon the Congealing code developed by Erik Learned-Miller from the University of Massachusetts \cite{joint-alignment}. In the paper Learned-Miller utilises the Congealing algorithm to align both MNIST handwriting data and MRI Scans by reducing the variability between each pixel within a stack of images. For example, the algorithm will analyse the properties of the upper-leftmost pixel in image 1, then in image 2 and through each image in the set. This variation between pixels is known as Entropy, and thus the objective of Congealing is to minimise the Entropy across a set of images.

The aim of this project will be to implement the Congealing algorithm using not only Entropy, as in Learned-Miller's application, but using other metrics such as Fuzzy Entropy, and Least Squares as implemented in \cite{least-squares-congealing}. As for the data to feed into the application, my image set of choice will be Mammography scans, however due to their large file size initial experimentation will be run using the MNIST handwriting data set.

Aligning mammography scans would help build an average of the image set. With this is in mind it is possible to build an average for the 4 breast tissue composition categories outlined by BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) - with 1 being fatty tissue (lowest risk) and 4 being dense tissue (highest risk) \cite{bi-rads}. Approaching this alignment of images using different metrics would output different a range of output results, and further investigation could be undertaken to ascertain the best alignment metric.

Finally, the resulting software tool could be used by Radiologists in assessing the tissue variation between the 4 categories and could also be used to build a classifier model.
