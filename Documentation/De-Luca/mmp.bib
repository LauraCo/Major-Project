This “entropy≓ may be regarded as a measure of a quantity of information which is not necessarily related to random experiments. Some mathematical properties of this functional are analyzed and some considerations on its applicability to pattern analysis are made.}, number={4}, journal={Information and Control}, author={De Luca, A. and Termini, S.}, year={1972}, month={May}, pages={301–312},

A number of schemes have been proposed to combine the fuzzy set theory and its application to the entropy concept as a fuzzy information measurements. The entropy concept, as a relative degree of randomness, has been utilized to measure the fuzziness in a fuzzy set or system. However, a major difference exists between the classical Shannon entropy and the fuzzy entropy. In fact while the later deals with vagueness and ambiguous uncertainties, the former tackles probabilistic uncertainties (randomness)}, booktitle={The 10th IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 2001}, author={Al-Sharhan, S. and Karray, F. and Gueaieb, W. and Basir, O.}, year={2001}, pages={1135–1139},
