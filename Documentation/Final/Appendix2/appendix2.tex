\noindent \textbf{Please provide a brief summary of your project (150 word max)}
I will be investigating the use of Congealing multiple MIAS dataset mammograms using several fuzzy entropy alignment metrics. If time permits I plan on speaking to a specialist (radiologist) to determine whether the output mean images of the congealing process are of any significant use to the research into breast cancer detection.

\noindent \textbf{I can confirm that the study does not involve vulnerable participants including participants under the age of 18, those with learning/communication or associated difficulties or those that are otherwise unable to provide informed consent?}
Yes

\noindent \textbf{I can confirm that the participants will not be asked to take part in the study without their consent or knowledge at the time and participants will be fully informed of the purpose of the research (including what data will be gathered and how it shall be used during and after the study). Participants will also be given time to consider whether they wish to take part in the study and be given the right to withdraw at any given time.}
Yes

\noindent \textbf{I can confirm that there is no risk that the nature of the research topic might lead to disclosures from the participant concerning their own involvement in illegal activities or other activities that represent a risk to themselves or others (e.g. sexual activity, drug use or professional misconduct). Should a disclosure be made, you should be aware of your responsibilities and boundaries as a researcher and be aware of whom to contact should the need arise (i.e. your supervisor).}
Yes

\noindent \textbf{I can confirm that the study will not induce stress, anxiety, lead to humiliation or cause harm or any other negative consequences beyond the risks encountered in the participantâ€™s day-to-day lives.}
