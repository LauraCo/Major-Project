\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

The Objectives for this project are are follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Align images using fuzzy entropy algorithms.} Images should be passed in, and it should be clear that an aligned version of the input images is calculated and output.
  \item \textbf{Answer any other relevant research questions associated with this project.} These are covered in Subsection \ref{ssec:research-qs}
  \item \textbf{Create a tool to streamline inputting images and viewing the output.} As this project uses light-weight, simpler fuzzy entropy algorithms to hopefully speed up processing time \textit{(see next objective)}, then the tool in which you run them should reflect this.
  \item \textbf{Create a quick tool which can be used on anyone's laptop or PC.} Not many people outside of the research community use tools such as MATLAB, so to be able to run a simple executable program is important.
  \item \textbf{Research and implement a solution to remove medical markers from mammogram scans.} As the \Gls{Congealing} algorithm looks to align the scans using grey-level pixel values, then the white medical markers in many mammograms create an issue as these will also try to align.
\end{itemize}
