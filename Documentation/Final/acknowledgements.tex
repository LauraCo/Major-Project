I would like to thank my Supervisor, Dr. Neil Mac Parthal\'ain, for all of his help and unwavering guidance throughout this project.

Likewise I am thankful to Ryan for being my constant rock, always happy to lend an ear when I needed to work through an issue and always on hand when I needed moral support.

I'd also like to thank my family, in particular my parents and sister, for their encouragement and continuous support in my academic choices.

I am extremely grateful to my all of my friends, especially Charles, Lewis, Josh, Ben and Katie for their technical knowledge, their help in proof-reading my written work and above all keeping me sane in stressful times.

Finally, a special thank you goes out to Dr. Hannah Dee, Dr. Harry Strange, Fangyi Li and all the other lecturers, support staff and PhD students for their invaluable advice during the last three months, and indeed during my entire time here at Aberystwyth University.
