\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Task composition}

After both the background research and literature review were completed, a list of main \say{Tasks} to be undertaken in order to complete this Project was easily composed. These are outlined in the following subsections.

\subsubsection{Decide how best to implement Membership functions}

Fuzzy Entropy requires Membership functions, in which the data can be classified. This task would be to decide whether to dynamically calculate the Membership functions, or whether to statically define them within the back-end of the system.

\subsubsection{Research and choose which Fuzzy Entropy algorithms would be best suited to this project}

This project stresses the importance of running image alignment techniques on a standard laptop or PC.

\subsection{Research questions}

The research questions are tightly interwoven with the Objectives of this Project, outlined in Section \ref{sec:objectives}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Does the use of Fuzzy Entropy alignment metrics improve the alignment of mammograms?
  \item Do clinicians / radiographers / mammographers find the output at all useful?
  \item What advantages / disadvantages does each fuzzy entropy alignment metric entail?
\end{itemize}
