\chapter{Background \& Objectives}

\section{Project Description}
The Project is concerned with the alignment of multiple images using an image-alignment technique called Congealing \cite{joint-alignment}. The paper describes a method which utilises the Congealing algorithm to align both MNIST handwriting data and MRI Scans by reducing the pixel-wise uncertainty across a collection of images. This project aims to go further, aligning mammography scans and reducing the pixel-wise uncertainty using a number of different fuzzy entropy methods.
