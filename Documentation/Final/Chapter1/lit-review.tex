\section{Research Method}

%You need to describe briefly the life cycle model or research method that you used. You do not need to write about all of the different process models that you are aware of. Focus on the process model or research method that you have used. It is possible that you needed to adapt an existing method to suit your project; clearly identify what you used and how you adapted it for your needs.

\todo[inline]{Talk about lit review here}

For this project, a literature review was undertaken to assess the work completed by researchers in the fields of Fuzzy Entropy and image alignment methods.

\subsection{Entropy}

\subsection{Fuzzy Entropy}

There are three different types of uncertainty:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Probabilistic
  \item Possibilistic
  \item Indiscernibility
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Image Alignment methods}

Some work has already been undertaken to investigate image alignment using Fuzzy Entropy metrics, however typically they are computationally costly, and therefore slow to run. This project will be invesitgating whether there are simpler, more light-weight fuzzy entropy metrics which could be implemented, for more everyday use in image alignment. It will also be investigated if, and further how, the outputs of these alignments differ per each fuzzy entropy metric.
