\chapter{Third-Party Code and Libraries}

%If you have made use of any third party code or software libraries, i.e. any code that you have not designed and written yourself, then you must include this appendix.

%As has been said in lectures, it is acceptable and likely that you will make use of third-party code and software libraries. The key requirement is that we understand what is your original work and what work is based on that of other people.

This library was used without modification.

\section{Congealing Code}

The project focused on extending the existing Congealing Code implemented by Learned Miller et al in 2005. A Congealing demo is available on the Congealing website \cite{Learned-Miller} which is open for experimentation. The original demo code was modified and extended to be able to read in mammograms and to work with 2 Fuzzy Entropy algorithms.
