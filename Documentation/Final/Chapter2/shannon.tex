\section{Algorithms}

This section will provide an outline to the implementation of the Fuzzy Entropy algorithms, along with a brief outline of the Shannon Entropy implementation.

\subsection{Shannon Entropy}

Learned-Miller`s demo code was implemented using Shannon Entropy \cite{joint-alignment}. Whilst the predominant dataset was MNIST handwriting data \cite{lecun1998gradientbased}, which is a binary dataset (pixels were either black or white), this was not useful for this project as there is no variation in greyscale, even when a mean is taken of multiple images.

However, Learned-Miller had implemented code to handle the processing of greyscale and colour images, such as in MRI images. This ensured that no function needed to be created to handle grey-scale images, greatly reducing the pre-programming needed. The only image handling that was encountered was to do with the mammograms, and the creation of a large pgm file to pass into the \Gls{Congealing} algorithm, as in Section \ref{sec:tech-diff}
